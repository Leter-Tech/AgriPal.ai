## 🛑 **Problem Statement**

### **1. Agriculture’s Skewed Contribution to GDP**

* 🧑‍🌾 Nearly **45–50% of India’s population** depends on agriculture.
* 💰 But it contributes only **15–18% to the GDP**, showing **inefficiency and disguised unemployment**.
* ⚠️ **224 million Indians are still undernourished**, despite India being a top food producer.
* ⚠️ India loses **₹90,000+ crore (~$11 billion)** worth of food annually.

---

### **2. Middlemen & Unfair Pricing**

* Traditional APMC mandis involve **3–5 middlemen**, cutting farmers’ share to **as low as 31–43%**.
* Lack of access to alternative markets makes them **vulnerable to collusive pricing**.
* This leads to:
  - **Indebtedness**,
  - **Rural poverty**,
  - **Farmer suicides**,
  - **High consumer prices**.

---

### **3. Fragmented Landholdings & Outdated Land Policies**

* **86% of Indian farms** are **less than 2 hectares**, fragmented due to **generational inheritance**.

* The last major land reforms happened in the **1950s–60s**, focusing on **abolishing zamindari**, **imposing land ceilings**, and **reforming tenancy**.

* **No significant land reform has occurred since then**, despite drastic changes in population, land productivity needs, and economic conditions.

* Restrictive tenancy laws limit **leasing and pooling**, discouraging efficiency.

* This results in:
  - **Low mechanization** (~45% vs. 95% in the US),
  - **Subsistence farming**,
  - **Hidden unemployment**,
  - **Underutilization of land resources**,
  - **Limited scalability for modern, high-yield agriculture**.

---

### **4. Lack of Technology Access**

* Farmers lack access to:
  - **Machinery**,
  - **Irrigation**,
  - **Quality seeds**,
  - **Advisory services**.
* Barriers include:
  - Small land sizes
  - Poor credit access
  - Lack of awareness and digital literacy
  - Insecure tenancy
* Outcome: **Low yields**, **high food waste**, **lack of youth interest**.

---

### **5. Inefficient Market Linkages & Crop Planning**

* Farmers often choose crops **based on previous year’s prices**, leading to **gluts or shortages**.
* Post-harvest losses are as high as **30–40%** due to lack of **cold chains and storage**.
* Food wastage cost: ~**₹92,651 crore/year**.
* Consequences:
  - **Price crashes**,
  - **Food inflation**,
  - **Farmer debt**,
  - **Malnutrition**.

---

### **6. Policy Gaps & Failed Reforms**

* The **2020 Farm Bills**, aimed at liberalizing agri-markets, were **repealed due to mass protests**.
* Root causes:
  - **Lack of consultation**,
  - **Mistrust**,
  - **Poor federal coordination**.
* Consequence: **Mandi monopolies** remain, and **private sector participation is still low**.

---

## ✅ **Solution Framework**
